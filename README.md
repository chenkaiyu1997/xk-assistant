# This project is now deprecated due to the update of course selecting system.
# Overview
  This system is designed to help students select desired courses which is hard to get enrolled. This system feigns a web browser to send course select request to www.xk.fudan.edu.cn, with a frequency of nearly 10 times per second. In this way, the probability of getting enrolled is much higher than selecting courses manually. Meanwhile, if the system is set to run in 13:00 every day, it may help students select courses automatically during the whole second selecting period.
# How to Run
  Fill in your id, password and your desired course code in core.py, and then run core.py.
